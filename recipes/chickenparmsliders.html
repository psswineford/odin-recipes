        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
           <li>3 chicken breasts (1 ½ pounds total), cut into twelve 1/2-inch steaks</li>
           <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons fresh cracked black pepper</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
           <li>3 ounces grated fresh parmesan cheese</li>
           <li>3/4 cup marinara sauce</li>
           <li>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
           <li>1 package Kings Hawaiian Savory Butter Dinner Rolls</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.   Place rolls on a cutting board, using a serrated knife cut rolls in half lengthwise (without breaking rolls apart).  Open rolls and place tops on one side of a baking sheet and bottoms on the other side cut-side up.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small microwave-safe bowl, stir in garlic powder.  Brush butter on cut side of bread.  Bake bread for 8-10 minutes until bread is lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Prepare chicken by slicing the thickest part of the breast about ½” thick.  Cut the thinner part of the breast into pieces slightly larger than the individual rolls.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, warm a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Drizzle with olive oil.  Sprinkle chicken with 1/2 of salt and 1/2 of pepper. Cook until browned, flip and cook until cooked through, about 8 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Remove bread from oven.  Carefully remove top halves of rolls and place on a plate.  Set aside.  Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the bottom halves.  Top with cooked chicken pieces.  Drizzle each chicken piece with about 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce and top with mozzarella cheese.  Bake 5 minutes or until cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
            <li>Place top halves back on chicken.  Cut into sliders, serve and enjoy!</li>
